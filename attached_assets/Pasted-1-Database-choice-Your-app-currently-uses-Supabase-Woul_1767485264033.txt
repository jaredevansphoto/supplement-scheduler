1. Database choice: Your app currently uses Supabase. Would you like to keep Supabase or migrate to Prisma/SQLite as suggested in the document?
Actually, my current app on GitHub uses IndexedDB for client-side local storage, not Supabase (maybe a mix-up?). Since it's all local right now, I'd prefer to migrate to Prisma with SQLite as you suggested in the document. That keeps everything self-contained on Replit without needing external services, and it'll make multi-user support easier to implement. If Prisma/SQLite hits any snags on Replit, we could fall back to Supabase for cloud hosting, but let's start with the suggested approach.
2. Scope: Would you like me to implement all of these features, or focus on specific ones first? The full implementation would be a significant undertaking.
I'd like to implement all of them eventually, but since it's a big lift, let's break it down step by step to keep things manageable. Start with the core: multi-user support with NextAuth (question 1 from your list), database schema changes with Prisma/SQLite (question 2), and seeding the supplement data (your question 4 below). Once that's solid, we can add RDA/UL tracking with warnings (3), cycling rules (4), intake aggregation (5), and smart warnings (6). That way, we can test incrementally.
3. Authentication: The document suggests NextAuth, but Supabase also has built-in auth. Which would you prefer?
Since we're going with Prisma/SQLite (not Supabase), NextAuth makes sense as suggested—it integrates well with Next.js and keeps auth flexible (e.g., for Google or credentials). No need for Supabase auth unless we switch DBs later.
4. The supplement data: Do you have the actual JSON data files with your supplements, ingredients, and upper limits that need to be seeded into the database?
I don't have pre-made JSON files, but I provided the raw documents in my initial query (Daily Supplement Schedule.docx, Supplement Upper Limits.rtf, and Supplement Stack.rtf). You can parse those into structured JSON for seeding, as outlined in the document (e.g., using the seed.ts script). If needed, I can help refine the parsing, but the data is all there—supplements with ingredients/doses, ULs with RDA/notes, and schedule/cycling rules.
